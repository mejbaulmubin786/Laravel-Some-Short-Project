to choose one ofthem so we'll choose this one the firstone Jim liar so we'll copy this commandPP addition J install liar so contrl Cand we'll go back to our Command Promptagain and uhwe'll past the command expiration justinstall liver and press enter so thiswill install liary in our project so Iagain fast forward thevideo so liary installation is alsocomplete so after this uh here afterthis command install Liber we go downand here you can see finalizing theinstallation so we need to run thesethree command nbm install npm run Billand then PSP my gate but before runningPS Edition myate we'll make some changesin our code so let me just copy this Pcommand uh npm install and we'll go backto our Command Prompt again paste thecommand and press enter so after npminstall we'll run this command npm runbuild pressenter and there you go npm run bill isalso done so here you can see the lastis PP addition my gate but before thisforand we need to make some changes inour code in order to make multipleauthentication so for it let's go backto our code and uh we just directly goto our database folder and insidedatabase we have the migrations folderwe'll go inside migrations and here youcan see we have the user table we'll goinside the user table and here you cansee name email password and some otherthing so over here we'll add one morefield and that field name will be usertype so we'll say here table stting inSt of name we'll say hereuser type and by default we'll give theuser type value and the default valuewill be user default value user meanswhen the user log in then it will takethe user to the user dashboard and whenthe default value uh when the user typevalue is admin then it will take theuser to the admin dashboard when theyare loged in so let me just add two morefield over here uh let me just copy thisand paste it here two times let's alsojust make it null L we'll say here nullL here andhere so here inad of name we're going tosayphone and okay we do not need thiscolumn let me just remove this so wehave uh just one more extra col phoneand user typ type so let's just savethis and right now we'll go to our appthen models inside model we haveuser.php so we'll come over here andhere we're going to mention the F andthe user types so we give to Secondbracket we say here phone then a commahere then we say here user type so let'sset this and we can right now just closethis on so right now since we addedonward field uh user type field in thedatabase table we can run the commandPHP addition my gate so uh let me justgo to the common PR and we are going tosay here PHP or thismigrate and pressenter so there you can see some table ismigrated in our database table so rightnow let me just show you the databasetable so this is our database call Portand we have the user table here here youcan see if we go in the user t you cansee phone field and the user type fieldso right now since we already installedJ team and write all the command forinstalling J in our project so right nowif we just refresh our project we'll seea login and register option which wascreated by J Ste so let's go andregister to user so right now we'llclick on register right now you can seein the register we have name email andpassword F but in the database we haveone extra field called for number andthe usern name we get the default valuewhich is uh this all which is user soright now in order to uh have a phoneoption over here phone field over herewe need to go back to code and we justdirectly go toour resource fs and inside PS we havethe on folder over here and inside ofolder caring as register.php so we goinside register.php so let me justuh copy this pint for name Ary name soI'll copy this and paste it over hereafter email so instead of name we aregoing to say herephone this will be phone uh if pH andtype would be D okay that's fine andname will be phone as well and autocomplete let's say here pH so all thevalue will be phone EOP name so rightnow if we setthis then if we now refresh and you cansee we have one more filled over herefor phone number but if you give thefullone number and click on register thedata will be store in the user table uhfor it you know to upload the phonenumber to the database table we need tomake a little bit changes again and thatis we need to go to our app then actionsand inside action we have 45 folder sowe click on 4tify and there you can seecreate new user option so we'll click onit and we'll go down and here you cansee validator name email password okayso we can write a validation rule forthe phone number over here but we willnot we'll just directly come over hereuh return user create we'll copy thisthen paste it here and we're going tosay here phone P any phone and this namewill come from the database table whichis uh this one here you can see followthis oneokay and here you can see input here weneed to write phone again and this namethis fullone name will come from theregister.php from here here you can seename equal to phone so we can just savethis right now and we can just closethis and this one as well so right nowlet's go back to our browser let me justrefresh and let's give a name let's sayname will be user and email will be userat the of gmail.com let's just give arandom name phone number just a randomphone number and let's be a password 1 23 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 then clickregister and there you can see we areable to successfully register our userand this is the US user dashboard solet's go and register one more user sowe click over here and click logout so let's register another user we'llclick register and this time we'll sayhereadmin email will be admin gmail.com arandom phone number password will be 1 2345678 and 1 2345678 and click onregister you can see that the usernameis admin so right now if we just refreshour database table there you can seethere is two user uh over here you cansee the phone number and the user typeis by default both of them is userbecause wemention uh over here that the defaultvalue for the user type would be userthat's why so right now we're going tomodify the user type for the admin sohere in order to modify it uh for theuser time ad Bill uh you can just doubleclick over here and you'll be able tomodify it from here or on the left sideyou will see the edit option if youclick on edit you will also be able tomodify the user type so here you can seeuser type so inad of user we're going tosay hereadmin we'll go down right now and uhhere you can see the Go Button we'llclick go and there you can see the usertype is change to admin so right now weneed to modify our port in such a way sothat whenever user login then ourbrowser will take the user to the userdashboard and whenever the admin try tolog in then it will take the admin tothe admin dashboard so for it uh let'sgo back to our code and let me just showyou the routes first so if you go toroutes then web. phsp there you can seea route is created by J so we'll haveour own route to create multipleauthentication but before that here youcan see see dashboard. blade. PHP andwhatever things you are seeing over herecoming from the dashboard. blade. phqfrom this page okay so right now let mejust explain you how just is let youblog in and go to the dashboard thething is uh let me just log out thething is when you are trying to log infrom here what Jim does is that it willcall the ontic folder you can see contfolder inside cont folder we have 4y.PHP so inside 4y. PHP if you go downhere you can see equal to/ dashboard sowhenever we are trying to log in it willcall the SL dashboard URL so if we justgo to our routes then web.php and youcan see we have SL dashboard so wheneversomeone try to log in it call thedashboard drout so here in of dashboardwhere we going to say here slh home andright now we're going to write a routefor this slome in our web.php over hereso for it uh before we write the routelet's go and create a controller for theroute so let's go back to our commonfrom and in order to create thecontroller we need to say over here PHPrition make clonecontroller let's say our controller namewill be admin controller uh I did aspelling mistake for controller Co ncontroller so let's press enter andthere you can see a controller iscreated so right now if we go to our appHTTP controller there you can see admincontroller so we register this admincontroller in our web.php first so herewe're going to say use app a capitalback SLHTTP back slashcontrollers back slash admincontroller so we have register our admincontroller in our web.

PHP so we'll beable to access to the admin controllerso right now let's go and create a routeso here we are going to say route doubleclone get to first bracket to singlequotation SL home then we'll give acomma to third bracket we'll make sureour control name which is admincontroller to double clone classcomma to single quotation
